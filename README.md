##NSEIeod: Tool for collecting ieod data from nseindia.com (using nsetools package)

> This is still in development phase.
> The main idea behind that is to collect collect realtime data and save it in postgresql database(using psycopg2 and sqlalchemy) with unix timestamps
> I am still working on it so that I can collect data to do some quant research.
> You can also contibute in development if you want.

#### Installation
> you must have postgresql installed and running.
> clone this repo cd into it and do `pip install -e .`
> run `nseieod -h` command to see help, at the moment only `--init` works  
> I tested this on `Arch Linux` so I don't know if it'll work on other os.
